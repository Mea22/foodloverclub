        <h1> Pizza</h1>
        <p>Homemade pizza isn't something to be taken lightly. We're making a classic Neapolitan pizza and a classic roman pizza, and putting them together. Maybe there will be a winner, or maybe there will just be a lot of melty cheese. </p>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <h3>Neopolitan Dough Method:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat water to 95F. </li>
            <li>Add instant yeast, stirring together, and let sit for 5 minutes at room temperature. </li>
            <li>In a large bowl, mix together 00-Tipo flour and fine sea salt.</li>
            <li>Add all the water to the flour and mix by hand until a shaggy dough forms.</li>
            <li>Cover with plastic wrap and let sit for 20 minutes at room temperature.</li>
            <li>Remove dough onto a work surface and knead using the slap and fold method for 1-2 minutes or until the dough starts to turn smooth.</li>
            <li>Transfer the dough back to the bowl, cover, and let rest for 15 more minutes.</li>
            <li>Slap and fold again for 1-2 minutes, roll into a taut bowl, and place back into a bowl coated in extra virgin olive oil. Completely cover with plastic wrap and fridge for 14-18 hours. </li>
            <li>Punch all the air out of the dough. Divide dough into 5 even pieces (250 g each). Push out all the air and fold all the sides in before rolling into a taut ball seam side down.</li>
            <li>Add to a proofing box (or rimmed baking sheet dusted with flour), cover, and let proof at room temperature for 3-4 hours. </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Sauce Method:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Add tomatoes to a large bowl using a strainer, squeezing out the excess water. Add all the tomato flesh to a food processor along with garlic cloves, and extra virgin olive. </li>
            <li>Process until extremely smooth and season to taste with salt and a pinch of sugar.</li>
            <li>Blend together and pass through a fine-mesh sieve, pushing out as much pulp as possible into a container.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Neapolitan Pizza Assembly:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat pizza oven to 800-850F. </li>
            <li>Place a dough round onto a generously floured pizza peel. Flour the top of the round and using a fist, punch down leaving a thin border, and drape the dough over one’s knuckles and stretch and turn until a 10-12-inch round forms. </li>
            <li>Top with a couple of tablespoons of pizza sauce and spread evenly followed by torn mozzarella and basil leaves.</li>
            <li>Place pizza in the pizza oven cooking for 30-45 seconds until one side begins to char. Quickly turn it 180 degrees and cook for another 30-45 seconds. </li>
            <li>Remove and add a light drizzle of olive oil, flakey salt, and fresh cracked pepper. </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Roman Dough Method:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat water to 95F. </li>
            <li>Add instant yeast, stirring together, and let sit for 5 minutes at room temperature.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, mix together the bread flour and fine sea salt. </li>
            <li>Once the yeast has bloomed, whisk in olive oil until combined.</li>
            <li>Add all the water to the flour and mix by hand until a shaggy dough forms.</li>
            <li>Cover with plastic wrap and let sit for 20 minutes at room temperature.</li>
            <li>Remove dough onto a work surface and knead using the slap and fold method for 1-2 minutes or until the dough starts to turn smooth. </li>
            <li>Transfer the dough back to the bowl, cover, and let rest for 15 more minutes</li>
            <li>Slap and fold again for 1-2 minutes, roll into a taut bowl, and place back into a bowl coated in extra virgin olive oil. Completely cover with plastic wrap and fridge for 14-18 hours. </li>
            <li>Generously coat a rimmed baking sheet with olive oil. Add degassed dough to the baking sheet making sure to evenly spread the dough out to the edges.</li>
            <li>Cover with an inverted baking sheet, wrap in plastic wrap, and proof at room temperature for 2 hours.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Roman Sauce Method:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a medium saucepot, add the diced pancetta and olive oil, and heat over medium heat. Cook for 2-4 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
            <li>Add sliced garlic, stir in, and saute for 1 minute.</li>
            <li>Add in the can of crushed tomatoes, stir together, and bring to a boil then reduce heat to low and simmer for 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Season with salt and a pinch of sugar. Stir in additional olive oil.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Toppings Methods:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>For mushrooms, sliced mushrooms into quarters and add cut side down to a medium skillet coated in oil over medium-high. Sear for 2 minutes. Toss and continue to cook until soft and season with salt and pepper. Remove from pan and set to the side. </li>
            <li>To the same (cleaned and re-oiled) skillet, add the roughly diced onion. Saute for 4 minutes and season with salt. Add to the same bowl as the mushrooms and top with chopped thyme leaves and toss together. </li>
            <li>For the pepperoni, simply slice it into separate slices. </li>
            <li>For the cheese mixture, toss together the grated mozzarella and Parmigiano until well combined. </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Roman Pizza Assembly</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Generously cover the dough with sauce to coat the dough evenly. </li>
            <li>Cover with the mixed cheeses across the entire surface leaving a slight border. </li>
            <li>To ⅓ of the pizza, add the mushroom toppings. </li>
            <li>The other ⅓ of the pizza with pepperoni slices.</li>
            <li>And the last ⅓ of the pizza with just cheese. </li>
            <li>Bake in a preheated oven set to 500F for 20-25 minutes</li>
        </ol>
